**YearTeam** - The season the team played in & the university's D1 college basketball team participating in the tournament. This would traditionally be two columns, but the year does not have an impact on the statistical analysis, and it is easier to see the data when presented this way.

**Seed** - The seed given to the team by the panel that created the season's bracket. There are 4 regions in the bracket that each have 16 seeds.
  *Note: While there have been 1-4 play-in games since 2001, these play-in games are ignored for this exercise, as the seeds that are in the play-in games has changed by year, and do not affect the round of 64/going forward.*
  
**Conf** - The conference the team played in that season

**Stats go here**

**R64Res** - The result of the team playing in the Round of 64. A 1 represents a win and a 0 a loss. This is the target variable.
